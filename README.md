# photagService

PhotagService is a backend service to allow user upload photo, and view it in a list like instagram.

ToDo: user can tag photo by hashtag, mention, category, location, date, etc, and user can search and view a list of photo by the tags.

This project is to demonstrate the usage of `express`, google API (i.e. `google-auth-library`), jwt signing and authorizatipn, `mongo` and `mongoose`
